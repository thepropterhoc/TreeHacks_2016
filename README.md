Diagnosing walking disorders with accelerometers and machine learning

Author : _Shelby Vanhooser_

___
### Goals

  - Log data of walking behavior for a known distance through a smartphone
  - Using nothing but an accelerometer on the smartphone, characterize walking behaviors as _good_ or _bad_ (classification)
  - Collect enough meaningful data to distinguish between these two classes, and draw inferences about them 

___
### Technologies

  - Wireless headphone triggering of sampling
  - Adjustable frequency for logging
  - Internal database for collection
  - Support Vector Machine (machine learning classification)
